> Unified Vulkan API ray tracing cross-platform library.

## Features and advantages

- Low-level library for ray tracing, based on Vulkan API (compute workflow)
- Fixed issues of previous projects, added sort of new features
- Reduced overheads, single command buffer support, highly optimized
- Support by common modern compilers (Visual Studio 2017, GCC 8.1)
- Support by modern graphics/compute accelerators (NVidia Pascal, AMD Radeon Vega, next-gens...)
- Can reach 100Mrays/s in top GPU's (tested RX Vega 64, in sponza scene, fully dynamic mode)
- Support 3D dimensional space (by default)

## Repository mirrors

- https://github.com/world8th/vRt
- https://gitlab.com/world8th/vRt

## Requirements

- Vulkan API 1.1 Support
- [Vulkan Memory Allocator](https://github.com/GPUOpen-LibrariesAndSDKs/VulkanMemoryAllocator)
- C++17 capable compiler
- GLSL to SPIR-V 1.3 compiler

## Compatibility Confirmed

- RX Vega 64
- GTX 1070

## Uncomfirmed

- RTX 2080, 2080 Ti (non-RTX mode only)
- GTX 1070 Ti, 1080 Ti (Pascal), 980, 980 Ti (Maxwell)
- RX Vega 56 and Raven Ridge
- RX 580, 480 (optimizations ready only for RX Vega 64 and that series)

## Roadmaps

 **October 2018**

- De-vendorize possible features
- HLSL shaders for non-core functionality
- Begin of development for OpenGL, OpenCL and CUDA interoperability

 **November 2018**

- Support for RTX graphics cards (RTX 2070, 2080, etc.)
- Support of RTX acceleration
- Support of extensions (which with RTX)

 **December 2018** (or beyond)

- Coming to alpha stage
- Advanced ray-tracing API
- Support for Vulkan API 1.2

 **Indefinite Term**

- Unit tests
- First implementations for games, engines, applications, blockchains
- Make custom GLSL/HLSL compiler for unified compatibility
- Support of PowerVR Wizard Ray Tracing, Intel Larrabee 2019
